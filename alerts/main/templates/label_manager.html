  The Label Manager Chrome extension runs as a Chrome app, and it downloads
  files to a location you specify while running. Specifically, for each 
  "Recent" list you have configured, the data will be downloaded as a text
  file to the directory you specify, formatted as <b>type-id</b> (as listed
  on the recents list.

<p>
  You will need to have Chrome installed to use the Label Manager, but once 
  it is installed you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE9wpaDjuDQ">create a shortcut on your desktop</a>.
