<p>When selecting an account to connect for subscriber notifications, it should
   be a <b>Gmail account</b>. For users who use a Google+ Page (e.g. if you don't
   use your real name for your YouTube Account), this usually means it will be
   <b>different</b> from your YouTube account.</p>
<p>You must enable subscription notifications to be delivered over email. 
   Visit your <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/account_notifications">Notification
   Settings</a> and ensure "Send me emails about my YouTube activity (except
   emails I've unsubscribed from)" is checked; and you do not have any Unsubscribed notfications.</p>
<p>When you reach 1000 subscribers, you will need to visit this page again, 
   since new subscriber emails are automatically disabled when you reach 1000
   subs.</p>
