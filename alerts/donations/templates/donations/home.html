<h2>Donations</h2>
Livestream Alerts tracks donations for the purposes of recent, top donations, and historical data.

You can access a <a href="/donations/list">list of your donations</a> with names, dates, and amounts.

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
  You can create a donation goal to use in your stream. You can manage your 
  donation goals on the <a href="/donations/goals">donation goals</a> page, or simply <a href="/donations/goal">add a new goal</a>.
</p>
{% if goal %}
  Current Goal: <a href="/donations/goal_popup?id={{goal.id}}&key={{key.key}}">{{goal.description}} (${{goal.amount|floatformat:2}})</a>
